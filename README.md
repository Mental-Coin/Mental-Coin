### Welcome to $MENTAL!

There has never been more of a societal need to focus on our mental health. The ramifications that Covid-19's influence has had on our inner state is reflecting in our mental health statistics: an increase in suicide rates, opioid use, alcohol abuse and depression. Mental coin is the response to combat mental health problems through the use of smart contracts and blockchain managed tracking of donations which, if successful, could establish a new norm for transparency in philanthropy.

$MENTAL is a deflationary token that provides returns to holders, reloads the MENTAL/BNB pool, and donates to charity. This ensures that our pool always has enough liqudity while also providing incentives for our community and charitable organizations. 

During each transaction, an 8% tax occurs. The breakdown is as follows:
  
2% autodistributed to $MENTAL holders, 2% added back to MENTAL/BNB pool, 2% sent to a charity wallet (denominated in BNB), and 2% sent to a marketing wallet        (denominated in BNB)

Our developer minted the tokens, burned 80% to the dead wallet, provided liquidity to PancakeSwap, and locked the LPs in DxSale. This eliminates the possibility of a rug-pull!

By joining our community, you have the chance to be at the forefront of cryptocurrency while giving back. Let's send this to the moon!
